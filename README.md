# C template for Advent of Code

I put together this template for solving Advent of Code in C. Nothing fancy, just a solution runner with very basic support for testing, some utils, a script to generate boilerplate, and CMake support.

`./new.sh 1` to generate boilerplate for day 1.

`cmake --preset debug` to configure.

`cmake --build --preset debug` to build.

`cmake --workflow --preset debug` to configure and build in one go.

Below is a template you can use for the readme contents.
